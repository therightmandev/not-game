goal for these notes: make shitty video about what I'm doing, hopefully someone comments and it starts a conversation.

intro

I was watching game dev videos and I decided to start working on my own project. The goal is not to make a good game. It's not even to make a game. It is just to do what I like in that moment. When I started I was really wanting to make particles that looked cool.

day 1

I was inspired by art made with different shades of the same color as well as action games that feel satisfying and have a lot of particles.

Currently I'm trying to create a ball that produces some cool looking particles and moves around in a fun way. The reason it is a ball is because that's what the quick start page in pygame had as an example. (record some footage of current state of the game, record without flux filter)


day 2

I like the particles it creates when it moves. (cue clip) I tried making some less intense particles for when it's not moving but I don't like how it looks right now. I think I will just remove these for now and focus on something else, like some bouncy movement or shooting something.

# Or making a cooler looking ball or some other shape.

I'm thinking of doing really snappy movement, I tried increasing the speed and I really enjoyed playing with it (cue clip 2, maybe make note on video to ignore color change due to flux).

day 3 

I thought moving it with WASD was quite annoying, especially the up and down keys. I made it keep moving wherever you go and made it bounce off the walls. Also made it so you can only move horizontally and vertically and pressing spacebar stops the ball. (clip)

Reduced ball size. Thinking of creating a dash movement.

I made a dash! I also added some debugging text and some points to see if the dash was always the same distance. For the dash animation I made it slow down at the end. The first half of the distance is in full speed. From 50% to 75% it slows down linearly by 30% and from 75% to 100% of the distance it slows down linearly the rest of the speed, so it was going at 70% speed and it slows down linearly with a minimum speed of 10%. (recorded clip)

I don't think this speed animation is very noticeable, so I may adjust the values, but I think it is noticeable if I remove it. (cue clips side by side)

day 4
Created ellipse to change shape during dash. (cue clip) For smoother movement, the speed doesn't stop reducing at 10% anymore. What happens now is it keeps reducing until the ball reaches the target, but the ball reaches the target when the speed is around 10%.

I think I wanna do an explosion effect for when the ball hits something. I wanna do smoke clouds, or some fluorescent colored explosion or something. But before that I'm gonna implement the left dash.

I made the left dash, which was really nice because it allowed me to clean up and understand the dash code I had made a bit more. (cue clip)

Now I have to implement extra_dash again, which I forgot.

Done, movement feels nice, now trying size variations, so we can have more dashes instead of just two across the whole screen. (cue clip) I temporarily removed particles because with the smaller ball the particles took a lot of visual space and I couldn't get a feel for what the ball looked like.

Maybe now I'll make an explosion. 

day 5

Drew a line, the point is to dash at enemies to make them explode and the line is the dash path (used to aim).

Made diagonal dashes (only going up) (cue clip). I didn't limit the dash when going up, which makes for a buggy interaction when we try to go out of bounds.

Making the ball go back down after dashing diagonally is taking some more work (cue clip of ball going down but skipping target).

Fixed that (cue clip)

I wanna move on to the explosion but at the same time I wanna keep tinkering with movement. For example, when I tried using multiple attacks (diagonal dashes in a row) it didn't feel good because I've disabled the extra dash when doing attacks. Maybe I'll fix that. OK, that was an easy fix (cue clip) I just had to enable it again. I thought I would have to add extra functionality to it. Oh yeah, and I need to rotate the ellipse, let me do that now.

Fixed elipse direction (cue clip).

I made an enemy in MS Paint. I used Gimp to remove the white background. (cue clip) I also made the particles be on top of player instead of behind, to make the player more prominent.

I'm not sure about the "jump" mechanic. I like the movement, I just don't like that you have to press space and then A or D to do it. 

Now I made the movement just be the "jumps" and I'm kind of starting to like it. Now you can just use the A and D keys. (cue clip)

Tomorrow I wanna start recording, starting with voice.

That was the first 5 days. If you want to see more of this, please let me know by leaving a comment or a like. Thanks for watching.

--- RECORDED UNTIL HERE (make first video based on days 1-5) ---

day 6

I made a drawing that was meant to be smoke and I made it rotate just to see how image rotation works (cue clip). After that it became hard to do anything else.

day 7

I'm kind of overwhelmed with making the explosion, because the whole painting thing and rotating an image and making it look good is a lot to learn. I have to take it slow. I was expecting too much too quickly. I was basing it on my experience with the rest. I thought that since I made such a good looking thing already, then the explosion should be relatively easy, but there's quite a few more things to master with it, and manipulating images in pygame is on top of that list. Another thing is making good art, which is something that you just don't get good at in one night. And finally there's combining both things and make it look good. Now I have my expectations recallibrated. To reiterate what I set out to do at the start: I don't want to make a game. I don't even want to make something good. I want to make something bad, something that I enjoy doing and maybe get better at it as I keep doing it. But getting better is supposed to just be something that happens naturally. It's really hard to not create big expectations at some point. Luckily I noticed that that was happening, which has allowed me to return to working on this. If I hadn't noticed it, I may have left this alone for much longer than I have, maybe even not coming back to it ever again. And that may happen in the future. We'll see what happens.

So, taking one step at a time, the next step right now is to make the smoke look like it's coming from the enemy.

I suddenly had an idea and improved the player idle particles effect. Instead of deleting the particles after a set time, now they're deleted when they reach the border of the player.

I learned a bit about image rotation, but I'm leaving it for now because I'm too tired to follow all the math. I could just copy the code but right now I prefer to understand it before I use it. Especially because this is something that I feel like I can understand but I just haven't yet.

Created a new smoke image that's more round, so it doesn't need to be rotated, and gave it half opacity. (clip)

I have just learned about pygame's subsurfaces, so I can use that to make the enemy in pieces when exploding.

# Maybe edit this video down, either before making it (edit transcript) or after making. But before sounds like less work overall, and a good way to make a connected story before making the video.

Made some smoke that appears when I press a button. (cue clip)

For some reason the moving smoke is fully opaque. It was because I was running explosion() while the key is pressed, so it was running a bunch of times, creating lots of images on top of each other. The images were at half opacity, but the layering of so many of them made them look opaque.
